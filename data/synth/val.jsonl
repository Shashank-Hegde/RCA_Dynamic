{"text": "I am a 29-year-old woman living in Mumbai, and I have been experiencing persistent headaches over the last three weeks. Initially, it was just a mild discomfort, but it has progressively worsened to the point where it interferes with my daily activities. The pain is often throbbing and located primarily at the temples and behind the eyes. Along with the headaches, I've noticed sensitivity to light and occasional nausea, making it challenging to focus on my work as a graphic designer. I juggle a busy schedule and often work long hours in front of the computer, which might be contributing to the issue. I haven't had any significant health problems in the past, nor have I undergone any surgeries or hospitalizations. My family has a history of migraines, which causes me some concern. Although I maintain a mostly vegetarian diet and try to stay active, I occasionally skip meals due to workload. I also indulge in social drinking during weekends, but I don't smoke. My sleep has been erratic due to stress at work, and I'm starting to worry that all of this is affecting my mental health. I really need some advice on managing these headaches better, as they are beginning to impact my quality of life considerably.", "extracted": {"age": 29, "sex": "female", "ethnicity": null, "socioeconomic_status": null, "location": "Mumbai", "region": "Maharashtra", "past_conditions": null, "surgeries": null, "hospitalisations": null, "chronic_illnesses": null, "medication_history": null, "immunisation_status": null, "allergies": null, "family_history": "migraines", "diet": "mostly vegetarian", "physical_activity": "active", "sleep_pattern": "erratic", "alcohol": "social drinking on weekends", "tobacco": "none", "mental_health": "stressed due to work", "work_stress": "high", "environmental_exposure": null, "housing": null, "clean_water": null, "occupation": "graphic designer", "symptom_duration_map": {"headache": "3 weeks"}, "symptom_intensity_map": {"headache": "severe"}}, "label_leaf_id": "headache_migraine", "risk": 0.7, "uid": "b5560d54"}

{"text": "Hello, my name is Ramesh, and I'm a 32-year-old male from Pune, Maharashtra.
