{"text": "Hello, I'm a 34-year-old male living in Bangalore, and I've been experiencing severe headaches for the past two weeks. These headaches often feel like they are right at the top of my head, and sometimes they spread to one side of my face, making it quite difficult for me to concentrate on my work. I am a software engineer, and the work-related stress might have contributed to my condition. My sleep pattern has not been great lately, as I\u2019ve been staying up late to meet project deadlines, and I suspect that this is affecting my health as well. I do not have any chronic illnesses that I know of, and I've never had surgery. My past medical history has been relatively normal, but I occasionally suffer from seasonal allergies, particularly to dust and pollen. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to maintain a balanced diet, though I admit my physical activity regime has taken a backseat due to work pressure. I am concerned that if these headaches continue, it could severely impact my productivity and well-being, so I thought it best to seek some advice.", "extracted": {"age": 34, "sex": "male", "ethnicity": "Indian", "socioeconomic_status": "middle", "location": "Bangalore", "region": "Karnataka", "past_conditions": "seasonal allergies", "surgeries": null, "hospitalisations": null, "chronic_illnesses": null, "medication_history": null, "immunisation_status": null, "allergies": "dust and pollen", "family_history": null, "diet": "balanced", "physical_activity": "low", "sleep_pattern": "poor", "alcohol": "no", "tobacco": "no", "mental_health": null, "work_stress": "high", "environmental_exposure": "high dust exposure", "housing": "urban apartment", "clean_water": "yes", "occupation": "software engineer", "symptom_duration_map": {"headache": 14}, "symptom_intensity_map": {"headache": 8}}, "label_leaf_id": "headache_migraine", "risk": 0.7, "uid": "fa8a0f95"}
{"text": "Hello, I'm a 32-year-old woman from Jaipur, Rajasthan, and I have been feeling unwell for the past two weeks. Initially, it started with a low-grade fever and a constant cough, but over time, the cough has worsened, becoming more severe and persistent. I also experience fatigue and occasional body aches, which make it difficult for me to carry out my daily activities. I have no known allergies and have never undergone any surgeries. In the past, I have had some respiratory infections, but I have never been hospitalized. I do take multivitamins occasionally but am not on any other regular medication.

{"text": "Hello, my name is Rajesh, and I live in Pune, Maharashtra. For the past two weeks, I've been experiencing a persistent cough and a mild fever that seems to get worse in the evenings. I've tried over-the-counter cough syrups, but they haven't provided much relief. Initially, I thought it might just be a common cold, but the cough is quite severe now, making it difficult for me to sleep at night. I am 34 years old, male, and I work as an IT consultant. I'm generally healthy with no chronic illnesses; however, I do have a history of seasonal allergies, which makes me concerned that this could be related. I haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgeries, but I worry about the possibility of it being something more serious since my father had asthma. My diet is mostly vegetarian, and I try to stay active, but lately, the fatigue from this cough has limited my physical activity. I don\u2019t smoke or consume alcohol, and my mental health is generally good, though I have been feeling more stressed with work deadlines lately. I live in a rented apartment where I have access to clean water. It\u2019s just concerning since the symptoms aren\u2019t going away.

{"text": "I am a 35-year-old woman from Pune, Maharashtra, and I have been experiencing persistent headaches for the past three weeks now. Initially, I thought they were just the result of stress from work, as I have been handling an increased workload lately. The pain has been quite severe; it often makes it hard for me to concentrate on my tasks, sometimes accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. I do not have any previous history of migraines, but I have suffered from occasional tension headaches in the past. My family has a history of migraines, particularly my mother, who often experiences severe headaches herself. I try to maintain a balanced diet, but the irregular work hours can lead to skipped meals. I usually exercise a couple of times a week, but with my current workload, my physical activity has decreased. I drink alcohol socially, but I don\u2019t smoke. My sleep pattern has been poor lately, averaging just 5-6 hours of sleep at night, which I suspect has contributed to my condition.
